        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          For purposes of this Agreement, “you” or “your” refers to the person who has signed this Agreement under the
          person’s own name electronically, i.e., the person opening an account (“Account”) for the benefit of a
          beneficiary child (“Child”). You, the person(s) who has signed this Agreement, is our investment advisory
          client. Nobody else, e.g., the Child or any person who contributes money to the Account other than you (a
          “Contributor”), is our client. “We,” “us,” “our” “NestiFi” refers to NestiFi Holdings, Inc. an internet
          investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This Agreement provides us with a
          limited power of attorney and appoints NestiFi as your attorney-in-fact and agent, to access and provide your
          personal information to/UTMA/UGMA account providers and their proper agents, and to retrieve and use your
          information with the full power and authority to do and perform each thing necessary in connection with such
          activities as if you were doing them personally. Among other valid things, this Agreement means we are
          authorized to receive confirmations and statements, initiate contributions, perform investment option changes,
          make qualified withdrawals, inquire, and have access to your Account. We will not be permitted to change the
          owner of the Account, and we will not be able to add, change or delete banking instructions, or to transfer
          assets out or roll assets out of your Account without your permission. You consent to the electronic delivery
          of all documents and other information (including our Form ADV, Privacy Notice and any account disclosure
          documents). You confirm that you have received our Form ADV Part 2A brochure and our Privacy Notice You
          understand that NestiFi does not provide tax, legal, or other professional guidance, and you should seek such
          advice prior to investing any money. All of NestiFi’s clients are advised on a discretionary basis; NestiFi,
          rather than the client, will ultimately select the investment based on key information provided by the client.
          When a client deposits money, NestiFi constructs purchases to align the client’s account to their investment
          strategy. You confirm that you do not need, require or desire in-person or other personal investment advice.
          You acknowledge that NestiFi provides investment advice on portfolios for UTMA/UGMA accounts. In addition, you
          acknowledge that the investments in those portfolios (“Investment Choices”) may be limited in nature and may
          only contain certain types of securities (such as Exchange Traded Funds) and not a broader selection of
          investments. The security selection may also be further limited to a small select number of investments in the
          investable universe. These choices, which we refer to as “Investment Choices,” are listed on our website. You
          represent that, upon portfolio selection, you will complete any documentation that the investment requires,
          which currently requires that you provide your name, a U.S. permanent street address, and date of birth, among
          other information and/or documentation, that will be used to verify your identity. NestiFi uses a third-party
          service provider, Plaid, for bank authorization. Banking login credentials are never made accessible to
          NestiFi. Plaid takes deliberate steps designed to protect end user information in their possession. These
          steps include maintaining information security controls such as data encryption, firewalls, logical and
          physical access controls, and continuous monitoring. These controls are regularly evaluated for effectiveness
          against industry standards internally and by independent security auditors. (More resources on the security
          and privacy policies with Plaid: https://plaid.com/security/ https://plaid.com/legal/). You authorize NestiFi
          to use account and routing numbers obtained by Plaid, as required on enrollment forms, to open your NestiFi
          account. Use may vary by account and can be transferred to the enrollment/account application form as needed
          in either physical or digital form. If there are any changes made to your bank account via Plaid or directly
          with NestiFi , you must submit to NestiFi proof of account ownership in the form of bank statement (or other
          documentation requested by NestiFi) before any additional deposits or withdrawals can be made to your account.
          Any deposits made to your NestiFi account may be subject to a holding period of no less than 30 days before
          withdrawals on the account can be made. We may change our technologies and support services at our discretion
          at any time. We may change the Investment Choices, or reduce or expand the Investment Choices available, at
          our discretion from time to time. We reserve the right to implement a minimum investment or a minimum balance
          at our discretion. In the instance that NestiFi changes the Investment Choices, you consent to the use of your
          E-signature on any forms needed for such changes. By signing this Agreement, You confirm that the information
          provided to us in the Account opening process is accurate, and you agree to update us promptly when the
          information changes; You confirm that by selecting the US citizenship option during account registration, that
          the beneficiary is also a citizen of the United States. You agree to update us promptly if this information is
          incorrect or changes. You agree to use our services only for lawful purposes; You agree to provide us with a
          limited power of attorney; You agree that NestiFi will utilize NestiFi Securities, LLC, its affiliated
          broker-dealer (https://brokercheck.finra.org), to execute all trades in your Investment Account. NestiFi
          Securities, LLC will be the broker-dealer of record for your account. NestiFi Securities does not hold
          customer funds or securities. It executes trades on behalf of its client, NestiFi Advisers, LLC. Funds and
          Securities are held by Apex Clearing Corporation (“Apex”). All accounts will be invested in a NestiFi
          Tax-Advantaged Investment Account for Kids (“NestiFi Account for Kids”), a non-retirement custodian account
          established under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act or Uniform Transfer to Minors Act, that will be established
          for you at Apex. Each NestiFi Account for Kids identifies a beneficiary who will take control of the account
          at the age of transfer determined by the custodian. Please refer to the Apex Customer Account Agreement that
          you executed during NestiFi account registration. A copy of the Apex Customer Account Agreement can also be
          provided upon request. Apex charges additional fees for its services, and these fees are included in Appendix
          A. You agree to the additional representations, warranties and agreements set forth on Exhibit A hereto; and

          portfolio if your recurring deposit is above $25 dollars a transaction. Age-Based Portfolios, Aggressive

          services, including the personal use of the NestiFi web or mobile application. This fee is $4.99 per month;
          provided that NestiFi reserves the right to increase this fee on 30 days notice. The fee will be collected by
          the same method of payment that you selected for your investment contributions to the Account. At its sole
          discretion, NestiFi may forfeit the advisory fee for a period of time specified in the promotional materials.
          NestiFi reserves the right to sell shares out of your UTMA/UGMA or individual brokerage account to cover fees,
          including but not limited to, the subscription fee, advisory fee or other fees incurred. NestiFi also reserves
          the right to take fees out of the UTMA/UGMA if funds are not available in the original billing account
          (funding source). In addition to NestiFi’s fees, your Account may be subject to any distribution or
          transaction fees and the Investment Choices’ fees and expenses, and that those fees and expenses are generally
          disclosed in their disclosure documents. You understand that, even though NestiFi does not receive those fees
          and expenses, the Account’s investment returns will be reduced by these fees. Limitation of liability and
          indemnification. NestiFi, its personnel, its service providers, and its agents shall not be liable to you for
          any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss arising out of any investment or for any act or
          omission in advising or administering the Account or the performance NestiFi’s duties under this Agreement,

          warranty, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, for any indirect, special, incidental, exemplary,
          liquidated, or punitive damages. To the extent permitted by law, NestiFi’s liability shall be limited to fees
          actually received from the account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this paragraph or
          elsewhere in this Agreement shall constitute a waiver by you of any of your legal rights under applicable U.S.
          federal securities laws or any other laws whose applicability is not permitted to be contractually waived. We
          have no liability for events beyond our control. The Account should be considered a long-term investment, and
          changes to the Account (such as choosing different Investment Choices) should not be expected to be
          implemented on any particular timing, even if market events or other occurrences suggest urgency. You agree
          that you will, or you will cause the Account to, indemnify NestiFi, its personnel, its affiliates, its service
          providers, and its agents, for and to hold them harmless from any loss, claim, or dispute that may arise out

          effective beginning at the end of that 30 day period, we may amend this Agreement in any way, except to change
          the investment advisory fee structure or if we determine in our fiduciary duty that you, the Student, and/or
          the minor or the Account would be materially adversely affected by the amendment (unless we determine that the
          amendment is required for compliance with law). Any other amendments will only take effect upon your and our
          mutual agreement. Assignment. Neither NestiFi nor you may assign this Agreement (as “assignment” is defined

          Association. Miscellaneous. The enforceability or validity of any section, paragraph or provision of this
          Agreement shall not affect the enforceability or validity of the balance of this Agreement. A party’s failure
          to insist at any time on strict compliance with this Agreement or with any of the terms of the Agreement or
          any continued course of such conduct on its part will not constitute a waiver by it of any of its rights or
          privileges. Termination. NestiFi may immediately terminate this Agreement at any time by emailing you written
          notice or by other appropriate means of notice. You may terminate this Agreement without penalty upon 60 days’

          effective on a date other than month end and if NestiFi has been paid its investment advisory fee in advance,
          NestiFi shall refund any portion of its investment advisory fee to which it was not entitled, as calculated by
          us in good faith based on the pro rata portion of the month during which it provided services. For any
          investment advisory fee that remains owing, NestiFi is entitled to invoice you, and you agree to promptly pay
          the invoiced amount in full. After termination of this Agreement takes effect, the Contributors, the Student,
          and the Account will lose access to our technology solutions that support investments by family and friends.
